# Building the extension.

Dependencies: `npm`.

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. To compile the `main.css` file run `npm run build`. (For development run `npm run watch`)
3. Add the `manifest.json` file to your browser in developer mode to add the extension.

Note: You may have to point to this extension folder instead of the `manifest.json`.
Look at browser specific documentation as for how to add the extension.
